description: This is a tool I created during my summer 2016 internship with The Lubrizol Corporation. The statistics team has built a collection of models to predict the outcomes of various mechanical tests. Previously, the results of these predictions were collected into a spreadsheet. This made it difficult to quickly compare the results against one another. My tool plots the data instead, allowing for fast and easy comparisons.

This is a tool I created during my summer 2016 internship with [The Lubrizol Corporation](https://lubrizol.com/). The statistics team has built a collection of models to predict the outcomes of various mechanical tests. Previously, the results of these predictions were collected into a spreadsheet. This made it difficult to quickly compare the results against one another. My tool plots the data instead, allowing for fast and easy comparisons.

I used [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) to create the charts and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to style the page. You can [click here](https://bl.ocks.org/ensley/raw/09addcd400aafb5fdeb5cefa2b3bdcb6/) or on the image below for a live demo, and the [code is on GitHub](https://github.com/ensley/qp_charts).
