A dice game originating in 10th century Flanders. This applet was created to accompany an [article in _Convergence_](http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/wibolds-ludus-regularis-a-10th-century-board-game), a publication from the Mathematical Association of America that focuses on the history of mathematics.

The applet was written in Javascript. See the article for the rules of the game and the history behind it. The code is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/ensley/wibold). Click the screenshot below to play the game on the MAA website.
